          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever I read about blockchains, I often feel as if I'm being
            tossed into the lecture of a monotonic professor teaching bored
            students. Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus protocols, nakamoto
            coefficients, there's no wonder why most of the public thinks we're
            crazy. There's certainly a time and a place to technically explain
            cryptocurrencies, but for Nature Coin to achieve it's full potential
            it's paramount that we appeal to a broad audience. Thus, I hope you
            don't mind if I'm a bit more personal and engaging throughout this
            paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to set the stage for our project by calling attention to
            the following trends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Income inequality in the United States has grown substantially
              since the 1980's, with the ultra-rich enjoying an average annual
              income growth of about 6% while the poorest have actually seen
              their pre-tax income steadily decrease.

              In Canada, the price ratio of an average home to median income has
              risen 2.5x since 1976.

              Atmospheric concentrations of CO<sup>2</sup> have risen above 300
              parts per million (ppm) for the first time in over 800,000 years.
              In fact, we are now well over 400ppm.

            <li>
              Entrepreneurship has fallen by 17% across all high-income
              countries since 1991.
              <sup>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What do rising income inequality, housing prices, carbon emissions
            and falling entrepreneurship rates have in common? A global economy
            that has enabled these problems to compound. The prevailing economy
            in most parts of the world today, is capitalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we're going to discuss the shortcomings of capitalism, we should
            also highlight the benefits. Capitalism has shifted power from
            governments to corporations. In doing so, we've enabled generations
            of productivity resulting in technological breakthroughs,
            drastically improved standards of living, upward social mobility and
            freedom of oppression from the state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet it's obvious, from the trends aforementioned, that capitalism{" "}
            <i>is not</i> a silver bullet to all of our issues. This of course
            begs the question, is there a system in which we can enjoy the
            upsides of capitalism without the downsides? This is the underlying
            motivation behind Nature Coin. We'd like to eliminate climate
            change, alleviate social inequality and assist entrepreneurs while
            maintaining our opportunities and freedom of the current system.

          <p>To begin logically reasoning about such a system, </p>
          <p>
            One way to logically propose a new economic model is by following
            our history. The earliest known form of economic organization that I
            found during my research for Nature Coin is known as a "Palace
            economy", in which a central administration completely controls is
            known Feudalism flourished in Medieval Europe between the 9th and
            15th centuries
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm referring to value in the monetary sense of the word. I'll let
            you think about it for a moment. It's tricky isn't it, to define
            such an abstract term? I did what any millennial these days would
            do, and I just asked Google.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Value is the <i>regard</i> that something is held to deserve; the
            importance, worth, or usefulness of something.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In other words, value is completely made up! The things that you and
            I regard as valuable could be completely different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision behind Nature Coin is to build financial systems that
            ameliorate society and revitalize planet Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We envision creating an international stock market that is 10x
            better than any existing exchange. We are not going to do this by
            taking existing companies on the New York stock exchange and just
            turning them into digital assets. Rather, we want to re-think the
            entire purpose of trading securities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we propose a treasury system to fund environmental and
            social projects on a global scale.

          <h3>Capitalism</h3>

          <p>
            This newfound faith in privatization has spread to become the global
            economic phenomenon of the 1990s. Throughout the world, governments
            are turning over to private managers control of everything from
            electrical utilities to prisons, from railroads to education.
          </p>
          <p>What do all of these have in common? </p>
