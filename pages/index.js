          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever I read about blockchains, I often feel as if I'm being
            tossed into the lecture of a monotonic professor teaching bored
            students. Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus protocols, Nakamoto
            coefficients, ... no wonder people don't want to hear us talk about
            crypto! Today I want to talk about real world problems. I want to
            talk about how blockchain technology is not just solving computer
            science problems, but actually providing new solutions to our most
            dire issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to set the stage for our project by calling your attention
            to the following trends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Income inequality in the United States has grown substantially
              since the 1980's, with the ultra-rich enjoying an average annual
              income growth of about 6% while the poorest have actually seen
              their pre-tax income steadily decrease.

              In Canada, the price ratio of an average home to median income has
              risen 2.5x since 1976.

              parts per million (ppm) for the first time in over 800,000 years.
              In fact, we are now well over 400ppm.

              Entrepreneurship has fallen by 17% across all high-income
              countries since 1991.

          </ul>
          <p>
            What do rising income inequality, housing prices, carbon emissions
            and falling entrepreneurship rates have in common? A global economy
            that has enabled these problems to compound. The prevailing economy
            in most parts of the world today, is capitalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we're going to discuss the shortcomings of capitalism, we should
            also highlight the benefits. Capitalism has shifted power from
            governments to corporations. In doing so, we've enabled generations
            of productivity resulting in technological breakthroughs,
            drastically improved standards of living, upward social mobility and
            freedom of oppression from the state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet it's obvious, from the trends aforementioned, that capitalism{" "}
            <i>is not</i> a silver bullet to all of our issues. This of course
            begs the question, is there a system in which we can enjoy the
            upsides of capitalism without the downsides? This is the underlying
            motivation behind Nature Coin.
          </p>
          <p>
            To propose a new economic model, we must first understand the
            mechanisms of our existing one. The underlying incentive structure
            in capitalism is of course, to earn capital. This mindset of
            financial maximization has taken over the world. In 1966, a survey
            of U.S college freshmen found that only about 44 precent of them
            said that making a lot of money was "very important" or "essential".
            By 2013, that figure had jumped to 82 percent.
            <sup>

          </p>
          <p>
            It's not just individuals, our companies are also trying to rake in
            the dough. In fact, they're legally obligated to do so. “Directors
            of a for-profit Delaware corporation cannot deploy a [policy] to
            defend a business strategy that openly eschews stockholder wealth
            maximization - at least not consistent with the directors' fiduciary
            duties under Delaware law.”
            <sup>
              <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/csr/2010/09/21/what-ebays-court-fight-with-craigslist-reveals/?sh=25fb26ed2dd8">

              </a>
            </sup>{" "}
            More than 50% of publicly traded companies have chosen Delaware as
            their home.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's the significance of all this? We've decided as a society that
            the point of life is to maximize financial wealth. Oil gets
            extracted irregardless of the environmental damage. Exorbitant
            prices are charged for healthcare. Social media algorithms keep you
            engaged to show you as many ads as possible. Our potential for a
            more generous, moral, or fair society is limited by the dominance of
            money in everything that we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nature Coin represents an idea. The idea that our current definition
            of value can take on a much broader meaning. Furthermore, our
            collective capital can be used as an instrument of change to build
            the future that we want to live in. In essence, our existing
            petrodollars can be replaced by naturecoins.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not suggesting we should abolish capitalism. I'm not a
            communist! However, I believe we can tune the incentives in
            capitalism to reward social and environmental progress in addition
            to productivity. To do so, we need to change the very heart of
            capitalism: the stock market.

          <h2>Re-inventing the stock market</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange
            with a market capitalization of over US$30 trillion in securities.
            Yet despite it's absurd size, it's remained relatively stagnant from
            a technological standpoint. Books have been written on how to make
            money in the stock market, but as for the stock market itself? Every
            exciting upgrade to it's system is summarized in under 60 bullet
            points on a Wikipedia page.
            <sup>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange#Timeline">

            </sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The potential for innovation here is immense. We intend to create
            our own stock exchange, known as the Nature Coin Exchange which will
            be 10x better than any stock market in existence today.
          </p>
          <p>
            How are we going to build such an exchange? We can just take
            existing companies and tokenize their shares, right? Uh, no. We can
            do much better than listing for-profit Delaware corporations which,
            as mentioned earlier, are legally obligated to pursue profits above
            all else.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010 there was corporate law breakthrough when Maryland became
            the first U.S state to introduce the concept of a{" "}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">
              benefit corporation
            </a>
            , or B corporation for short. The difference between a traditional
            for-profit C corporation and a B corporation is subtle, yet
            powerful. A B corporation allows a business to pursue social and
            environmental initiatives in addition to profit as it's legally
            defined goals. This means that B corporations cannot be sued by
            their shareholders for pursuing activities outside of financial
            maximization. In other words, it completely changes the game. If you
            have time I'd encourage you to watch this{" "}

            from Jay Coen Gilbert, the founder of B Lab which certifies B
            corporations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We intend for the Nature Coin Exchange to host B corporations
            exclusively. In doing so, we can reward impactful businesses like
            Patagonia and Kickstarter which are not only making a pretty penny,
            but also providing for their employees, customers and the
            environment. We'll be able to provide liquidity for smaller
            companies who need additional capital to achieve their ambitious
            goals. We can convince the next generation of entrepeneurs to
            accomplish more than just filling the pockets of their largest
            shareholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The businesses listed on the Nature Coin Exchange are going to
            kick-ass. And that's not all. The Nature Coin Exchange will be the
            first decentralized stock market of it's kind to host real,
            non-synthetic securities. Here are some of the benefits:

              securities.

            <li>The exchange itself will be programmable.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I'd like to expand on the last two points. First, the Nature Coin
            Exchange will be democratic with a voting mechanism to determine the
            rules. In the crypto world this is known as a decentralized
            autonomous organization, or a DAO for short. The more naturecoin you
            own, the more voting power you have to determine the rules. One
            concern with such a system is that influential actors might attempt
            to change the rules to their own benefit, but game theory tells us
            that it would be foolish to do so because this would likely decrease
            the price of naturecoin, and thus their own wealth. There are
            several other ways of preventing attacks on the network which I'll
            discuss at another time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Democratically determining the rules opens up a world of endless
            possibilities. For example, we could vote to give companies more
            time between earnings reports to encourage them to place a smaller
            empthasis on near-term profits. Report requirements themselves could
            be voted on. Would you like to know the salary ratio between a
            company's CEO and their lowest paid employee? What about the
            company's carbon footprint? Or who their largest shareholders are?
            By forcing corporations to be more transparent, we the people can
            decide what type of corporate behavior we want to reward. If we
            invest wisely, the game will no longer be purely financial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progammability gives us some exciting new options as well. Index
            funds can be automatically updated to include or exclude companies
            based on a set of rules. There could be restrictions on your digital
            wallet to prevent fraud, for example, if you want to withdraw more
            than a few thousand dollars your friend Sally needs to sign off on
            the transaction. A billionaire tax? We could make it happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another programmable aspect of a cryptocurrency is inflation.
            Bitcoin is famous for it's predetermined supply logic in which the
            amount of new bitcoin mined decreases by half every four years. With
            Nature Coin, we're going to set our inflation at an annual constant
            rate of 2%. Why? The government has{" "}
            <a href="https://medium.com/the-ascent/you-are-being-lied-to-about-inflation-it-hasnt-been-2-for-30-years-here-s-proof-f62c6aa0efa9">
              lied about a 2% inflation rate
            </a>{" "}
            for years. YEARS! We intend to replace the current system with one
            that's honest. Our inflation will be split between two digital
            wallets, one which will fund development of the project itself and
            the other for a novel philanthropic effort.
          </p>
          <h2>A decentralized hive mind to fight climate change</h2>
          <p>
            Climate change is pervasive. There is no silver bullet that will
            save us from the severe natural disasters that are already here, and
            which are growing more frequent and more severe. We cannot place all
            of the blame on the fossil fuel companies. Afterall, we are the ones
            who drive cars, consume plastics, use electricity and heat our
            buildings creating a hungry demand that is never satiated.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we truly want to stop the climate crisis, it's going to require
            all of us. To modify our way of living, to consume less, to spend
            more for sustainable products, to be slightly more inefficient and
            use less energy. Nature Coin is not only an economic system, but an
            ideology which ushers humanity into a new era of societal behavior.
            If you desire what I desire, which is a healthier and more equitable
            planet, we are on the same team. The second pillar to Nature Coin is
            simply a system that allows us to work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system that I'm describing is a community controlled treasury
            for social and environmental projects. Here's how it will work. The
            treasury will be funded through a 1% annual inflation rate of Nature
            Coin. Members of the community can make proposals for funding -
            starting new businesses, donating to non-profits, lobbying
            politicians, etc. Funding will occur in rounds, during which we can
            all vote for our favorite proposals, and afterwards the most popular
            ones will be funded. The only limitation of such a system is the
            amount of funding available and the creativity of the Nature Coin
            community. You could imagine, with enough capital, we could fund new
            public transit systems! We could negotiate a deal with the
            construction company such that every citizen who buys a train ticket
            would be contributing a portion of their fare back to Nature Coin
            treasury, allowing us to re-invest in new projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I personally find so much beauty in coupling this system alongside
            the Nature Coin Exchange. Firstly, many of us feel hopeless right
            now against preventing climate change as it's such an enormous and
            systematic problem. If Nature Coin succeeds, we'll have a network in
            which anyone in the world can participate, propose and vote for
            solutions. The key insight here is that individually we are
            powerless, but collectively we are unstoppable. Second, by funding
            the treasury through the inflation of Nature Coin, we ensure that
            growth of the economy is directly correlated to an increase in
            funding for environmental projects. The bigger we get, the more
            positive impact we will have in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider again the size of the New York Stock Exchange, US$30
            trillion in assets. Now imagine hypothetically that Nature Coin
            reaches the same size. With an annual inflation rate of 1% rate we
            would have US$300 billion, per year, to put towards projects of the
            community's choice. I believe in 30 years time, by 2050, we can make
            it happen. Tesla took less than 20 years to be worth more than every
            large car company in the world, combined. Technology is consistently
            underestimated due to our relatively poor understanding of
            exponential growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, there you have it. That's the minimalist, hopefully not too
            technical explanation of Nature Coin's vision. I hope that I've
            given you new hope for a better world. I hope that you will join our
            community. Let's leave a dent in the universe.
          </p>
